The first list item could not have 4 leading spaces, this should be interpreted as a code block starting with `*`

    * this is not an item list

When there's a huge indentation difference between two list items the the second item should not be considered an item list

* this is the first item of the list
          *  this is notbe the second item in the second level but still the first item in the first level
