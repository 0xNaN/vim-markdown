# Vim Markdown Support
## Why?
Because I couldn't find a syntax file that would match my expectations

## Development
### Resources
* [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* [Markdown Debugger](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus)

## TODO
* how to automatically test that the syntax highlight is correct or at least to avoid regressions?
  * try with :TOhtml and compare that with a sample saved when the highlight of a particular element looks good
* support syntax for blockquotes
* support syntax for lists
* support syntax for code blocks
* support syntax for horizontal rules
* support syntax for links
* support syntax for emphasis
* support syntax for code
* support syntax for images
* support for tables with tabularize
* support for spell checking
