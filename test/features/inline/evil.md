A *single* line _could_ have **multiple** emphasis __elements__

SNAKE_CASE_WORDS will not be misunderstood for an _emphasis_ element

A _SNAKE_CASE_WORD could begin with an underscore

Unfortunately _SNAKE_CASE_WORDS_ could not begin and end with underscores

But underscore in a \_SNAKE_CASE_WORD_ could be escaped

Must NOT_BE trcked also by multiple SNAKE_CASE_WORDS on the same line

An _ emphasis element that contains multiple words could begin and end with spaces _

An _emphasis element
could not span multiple lines_

Two underscores __ or two asterisks ** must not be highlighted without something between them like

Four underscore ____ or four asterisks **** must not be highlighted without something between them

A single space is fine __ __ also a single character __c__ event a single symbol __*__
