_*foo*_ should be \*foo* highlighted in italic

*_foo_* should be \_foo_ highlighted in italic

**_foo_** should be \_foo_ highlighted in bold

__*foo*__ should be \*foo* highlighted in bold

___foo___ should be highlighted in bold and in italic

***foo*** should be highlighted in bold and in italic

What I'm trying to say here is the external delimiter is always going to win to what is inside, this in not what the markdown's syntax says but nesting those patterns for the highlight purpose doesn't make any sense
